<p>Forest of stones is a 2d mobile game built with unity. This was a major stepping stone in my design and software development journey. This project taught me to use c#, json files, character animation, particle effects, and unity to produce what I feel is a sucessful project.</p>

<h4 id="the-game-breaking-bug">The game breaking bug.</h4>

<p>Close to the completion of my project, I found a bug which caused the play.c# script not to run on the first time running the game. This bug was caused by a failure to create the player save data json file on the first execution of the game. Once found, this bug was very easy to fix by checking for a json file, and creating one if none is found. However, it was very difficult to diagnose for a variety of reasons.</p>

<h5 id="ambiguous-error-codes">Ambiguous error codes.</h5>
<p>The only eror code thrown by this bug was</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was caused by references to the player script not working, but it took me a while to realise this, and even then, the error provided no information about why the playerscript was not running.</p>
