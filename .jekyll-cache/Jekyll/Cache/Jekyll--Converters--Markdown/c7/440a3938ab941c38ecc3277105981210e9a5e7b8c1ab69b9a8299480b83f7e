Mariko is a basic, general purpose, admin-focused discord bot. It has been a side-project of mine in a private repository since the start of 2021, but I am excited to announce, it is now stable, and open-source! Mariko is built for Heroku, but could be easily adjusted to work with any other hosting system.</p>
